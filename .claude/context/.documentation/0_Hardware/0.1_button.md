# Button Component (Hardware Input - HAL Layer)

## Overview

`Button` is a low-level hardware abstraction for a physical momentary push button
connected to a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin.  
It belongs to the **Hardware Abstraction Layer (Layer 1)** and provides a clean,
debounced interface for detecting button presses.

The goal of this component is to unify GPIO interactions and prevent hardware
noise or bouncing from propagating into the higher-level application logic.

---

## Responsibilities

### ✔ Reads raw electrical state  
Uses `GPIO.input(pin)` to get HIGH/LOW state.

### ✔ Debouncing  
Filters mechanical bouncing through configurable debounce time.

### ✔ Falling-edge detection  
Returns `True` only when the button transitions from HIGH → LOW.

### ✔ Stateless public API  
Single `is_pressed()` method encapsulating the complete input logic.

---

## Non-Responsibilities

### ✘ No business logic  
It must not know about modes, rendering, animations, or events.

### ✘ No GPIO pin setup  
Pin registration/cleanup is handled by `GPIOManager`.

### ✘ No async  
The component is synchronous by design.

## Constructor

```python
Button(pin: int, debounce_time: float = 0.3)
