# Hardware Configuration
# GPIO pin assignments for encoders, buttons, and LED strips

encoders:
  selector:
    clk: 5
    dt: 6
    sw: 13

  modulator:
    clk: 16
    dt: 20
    sw: 21

buttons: [22, 26, 23, 24]

led_strips:  
  # GPIO-to-zones mapping
  # Specifies which zones are connected to which GPIO pin
  # Zones are rendered sequentially on their assigned GPIO
    - id: PIXEL
      gpio: 18
      zones: [FLOOR, LEFT, TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LAMP]  # Main zone strip (chained)
      color_order: BRG

    - id: PREVIEW
      gpio: 19
      zones: [PIXEL, PREVIEW]  # User zone strip (30px) + preview (8px, reversed)
      color_order: GRB
