# Hardware Configuration
# ====================
# Defines physical hardware components and their GPIO connections
#
# This is the source of truth for:
# - Which GPIO pins are used for each component
# - LED strip types and electrical properties (voltage, color order)
# - Physical pixel counts per LED strip
#
# LED strips defined here are mapped to logical zones via zone_mapping.yaml
# ConfigManager reads this file during startup to initialize hardware drivers
#
# GPIO pin assignments for encoders, buttons, and LED strips

buzzers:
  - id: PASSIVE
    gpio: 12

encoders:
  - id: selector
    clk: 5

  - id: modulator
    clk: 16
    dt: 20
    sw: 21

buttons: 
  - id: BTN1

led_strips:
  - id: MAIN_12V
    gpio: 18                # Primary LED chain (main display zones)
    type: WS2811_12V
    color_order: BGR        # WS2811 12V strips use BGR order
    count: 51               # Total pixels: FLOOR(18) + LEFT(4) + TOP(3) + RIGHT(4) + BOTTOM(3) + LAMP(19)
    voltage: 12

  - id: AUX_5V
    gpio: 19                # Auxiliary LED chain (pixel strips + preview)
    type: WS2812_5V
    color_order: GRB        # WS2812 5V strips use GRB order
    count: 68               # Total pixels: PIXEL(30) + PIXEL2(30) + PREVIEW(8)
    voltage: 5
  # LED Strip Definitions
  # ---------------------
  # Each entry defines a physical LED strip connected to a specific GPIO pin
  #
  # Fields:
  #   id:          Unique hardware identifier (referenced in zone_mapping.yaml)
  #   gpio:        BCM GPIO pin number (18, 19, etc.)
  #   type:        LED chip type (WS2811_12V, WS2812_5V, etc.)
  #   color_order: Pixel color channel order (BGR, GRB, RGB)
  #   count:       Total number of addressable pixels on this strip
  #   voltage:     Operating voltage (5V or 12V)
  #
  # Multi-GPIO Support:
  # - The system supports multiple LED strips on different GPIO pins
  # - Each strip is controlled independently via DMA
  # - Zones are assigned to strips via zone_mapping.yaml
  # - FrameManager routes pixel data to the correct strip based on zone.config.gpio
  #
  # Adding a new GPIO:
  # 1. Add a new entry here with unique id and gpio pin
  # 2. Add zone mappings in zone_mapping.yaml
  # 3. ConfigManager will automatically assign GPIO to zones
